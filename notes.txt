Need to denote when a player is eliminated: 
    Life = 0,
    Poison = 10,
    Commander Damage = 21 from a single commander,
    other (mill, condition, etc)

Have an icon on bottom of tile that will pull up secondary tracking:
    Need to track Poison counters 
    Need to track commander damage and from which player 
    dice roller (d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)

Need to have special tracking additionaly:
    Monarch
    City's blessing 
    ascend
    number of times commander cast 
    day/night
    initiative

Maybe as a custom field?
    energy
    experience 
    treasure tokens

Color picker for player backgrounds: (Also to be used for cmdr dmg )
    <label for="favcolor">Select your favorite color:</label>
<input type="color" id="favcolor" value="#ff0000">

maybe find a way to include the commander artwork in player's bg
